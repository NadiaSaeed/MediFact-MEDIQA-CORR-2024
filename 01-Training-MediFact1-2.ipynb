Two years ago, he was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, for which he underwent radiation therapy of the prostate and bilateral orchiectomy. One year postoperatively, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was undetectable. He missed his previous follow-up visit. Current medications include over-the-counter ibuprofen. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows tenderness of the spinous process of the third lumbar vertebra. Digital rectal examination shows a hard, nontender prostate. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. The serum PSA concentration is 16 ng/mL (N<4). A technetium-99m bone scan shows increased uptake at the second and third lumbar vertebral bodies.

At home, her parents try to address her frequent violations of curfew, but attempts at discussing the issue often result in their daughter losing her temper and screaming at her parents. Her grades have deteriorated over the past year. She has no history of psychiatric illness.

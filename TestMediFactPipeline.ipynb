Besides a worthy clinical experience, he also enjoyed local outdoor activities, like swimming and rafting. His past medical history is insignificant. The blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 100/min, and the temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F). On examination, there is a rash on the legs. Patient's symptoms are suspected to be due to hepatitis A. The rest of the examination is normal.\",\n          \"A 45-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of night sweats, cough, and a fever. Past medical history includes HIV infection diagnosed 10 years ago, managed with HAART. He says he hasn't been compliant with his HAART therapy as prescribed because it is too expensive and he is currently unemployed without insurance. A chest radiograph is performed and reveals a cavity in the right upper lobe of his lung. Mycobacterium avian complex is suspected.\",\n          \"A 65-year-old woman presents to a physician with painful ankles for 2 days. Her symptoms began 1 week ago with a severe fever (40 C (104 F )) for 3 days. When the fever subsided, she developed a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities with painful wrists and fingers. She also reports abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Last week she returned from a trip to Africa where she spent several weeks, mostly in rural areas. Her temperature is 37.5C (99.5 F ); pulse is 75/min; respiratory rate is 13/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. A maculopapular rash is observed over the trunk and limbs. Both ankles are swollen and painful to active and passive motion. The abdomen is soft without organomegaly. Dengue virus infection is suspected.
